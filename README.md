The client will attempt to connect to the server at `http://localhost:3000`.
The server path is defined in `env_vars.js`.

To run just execute:

`npm install`
<br />
`PORT=3001 npm start`

You are going to need some ASINs to test with :
<br />
`B002QYW8LW`
<br />
`B00DJPK8PA`
<br />
`B01M09QOBE`

ASINs will never be the same again.
